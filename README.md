## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/akdinesh2003/echovault-ai-response.git
    cd echovault-ai-response
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project and add your Firebase and Google Maps credentials. The app is already connected to a Firebase project, so you can use the credentials below.

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIzaSyDA98mp868M8n-wJPvD-anR7hkIrgOopE8"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="echovault-1b80q.firebaseapp.com"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="echovault-1b80q"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="echovault-1b80q.firebasestorage.app"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="361403673991"
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="1:361403673991:web:c4ecea2232da4af3b7f722"

    # Important: You must create your own Google Maps API Key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

4.  **Google Maps API Key Setup:**

    The application requires a Google Maps API key to display the map. **You must enable billing on your Google Cloud project for the map to work.** Google offers a generous free tier, so you are unlikely to incur charges for development purposes.

    -   Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    -   Select the project with the ID `echovault-1b80q`.
    -   Navigate to the **APIs & Services > Credentials** page.
    -   Click **Create credentials** and select **API key**.
    -   Copy the generated API key and paste it into your `.env.local` file for the `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` variable.
    -   Go to the [Google Cloud Console Billing page](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) and link a billing account to the `echovault-1b80q` project.

### Running the Application

Once the setup is complete, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) in your browser to see the application in action.
