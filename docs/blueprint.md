## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 214, 75%, 50% (RGB hex: #2196F3). The blue evokes a sense of trust and reliability, crucial for an emergency response application.
- Background color: HSL 214, 20%, 95% (RGB hex: #F0F8FF). A light, desaturated blue provides a clean and non-intrusive backdrop, ensuring readability and focus on content.
- Accent color: HSL 184, 65%, 50% (RGB hex: #2ACCCC). This analogous cyan/teal helps highlight important actions and information.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Use clear, universally recognized icons for different types of emergencies. Ensure icons are distinct and easily identifiable to facilitate quick reporting.
- Implement a clean, intuitive layout that prioritizes ease of use. Place key functions such as report submission and location sharing prominently for quick access.
- Use subtle animations to guide users through the reporting process. For example, a gentle pulsing animation on the 'Report' button to draw attention without being intrusive.
